            <h2>About Us</h2>

            <p>Welcome to Team Trees! We are a non-profit organization dedicated to planting trees and fighting climate
                change. Our mission is to create a greener planet by planting trees worldwide, restoring ecosystems, and
                improving air quality.</p>

            <p>Founded in 2019, our organization has already planted millions of trees and continues to work towards
                our goal of a healthier Earth. We collaborate with local communities, environmental organizations, and
                volunteers to ensure the success of our planting initiatives.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>

            <p>Our mission is simple: to combat climate change by planting trees. Each tree we plant absorbs carbon
                dioxide, supports wildlife, and contributes to a more sustainable future. We are committed to
                transparency and work tirelessly to ensure that every donation is used effectively to achieve our
                environmental goals.</p>
